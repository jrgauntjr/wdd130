            <p>Hi! I'm currently majoring in Computer science. I love to game, learn and talk about technology and fix/ build it as well.</p>
            <p>I'm not married as of now. I see that web design is crucial in our world, as many businesses and companies use websites</p>
            <p>I've been a member of the Church since birth, and it's been awesome. One of my favorite hymns is I know that my Redeemer lives.</p>
